# Cy#

Just a couple of compiler engineers playing with language design, seeking our interpretation of the razor's edge between safety, ergonomics, and performance in programming.

## Guiding Principles

* Cy# should be a statically-typed language, preventing classes of bugs that dynamically-typed languages suffer from.
* Cy# is focused on achieving a balance between ergonomics and performance. It is not intended to be entirely zero-cost abstractions, as Rust might be. At the same time, it should be pay-for-play; users should not have to pay costs for abstractions they are not using, and where possible we should leverage smart language and compiler design to bring the costs for an abstract as low as possible.
* Cy# is a multi-paradigm language, focussing equally on OO and functional programming aspects, with some procedural programming as well.

## Disclaimer

Yes, we are C# language designers. No, this repository is not indicative of anything that might or might not be coming to C#. We're just a couple of compiler developers playing with design in our spare time. C# and .NET are a great language and platform, [give them a try!](https://dot.net/).
